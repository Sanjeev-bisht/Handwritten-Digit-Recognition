# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

## Overview
This project demonstrates the process of capturing handwritten digits, generating a dataset, and training a machine learning model for handwritten digit recognition. The steps involve capturing images, processing them into a structured dataset, and then training a model to recognize digits.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- **pyscreenshot:** For capturing screenshots.
- **opencv-python:** For image processing.
- **pandas:** For data manipulation.
- **scikit-learn:** For model training and evaluation.
- **matplotlib:** For visualizing data.

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
  pip install pyscreenshot opencv-python pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

```
